<p>One of the greatest satisfactions behind the work on Example42 modules has always been to hear about people saying that they have learnt a lot about Puppet from these modules (even if many times they don't use them ... and this makes me think a bit :-O )<br /><br />Recently I was asked to prepare a dedicated and customized Puppet training session for a customer of a company I've started to work with and I was asked to prepare some training material for this occasion. At the same time this company has introduced me to <a href="https://github.com/aestasit/slidery">Slidery</a>, a Java library they are developing to convert markdown text into slides, using different presentation layouts (Desk.js, Impress.js, Reveal,js, PDF...). A Slidery plugin for Gradle makes all this very simple.</p><p>I got in love with this tool and felt the unstoppable temptation to use it to to provide some useful Puppet information to the community.</p><p>Here it is, then, the first , very young, set of Example42 Puppet Tutorials.</p><p>You can find the Markdown "source" code (and what's needed to build the slides) on <a href="https://github.com/example42/Example42-tutorials" title="Example42 Puppet Tutorials">GitHub</a>, and you can see directlty the first Tutorial sets:</p><p style="margin: 0px 0px 15px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Helvetica, arial, freesans, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;"><strong>Puppet Essentials</strong><br />What you need to know to start with Puppet<br /><a href="http://example42.com/tutorials/PuppetTutorial/">Rendered Slides</a> (In Deck.js) - <a href="https://github.com/example42/Example42-tutorials/tree/master/slides/essentials">Markdown source</a></p>
